                        <p class="statement__info-txt">This has not been a year without challenges but the business has made good progress in many areas, particularly in pursuing key strategic priorities, including: continuing to broaden its sales base in new categories and channels; driving supply chain improvements to reduce costs and further improve customer service; and delivering a good flow of new store openings. However, trading conditions during the important Easter and May Bank Holiday periods this year proved disappointing, caused primarily by a particularly warm early spring and the timing of the general election campaign. </p>
                        <p class="statement__info-txt">As expected, a normal pattern of trading resumed towards the end of the financial year. </p>
                        <p class="statement__info-txt">Revenue in the year grew by 13.4% with like-for-like order intake up 5.0% but adjusted EBITDA for the 2014/15 year declined to £11.3 million (from £13.7 million in 2014) due to the initial losses on the House of Fraser concession agreement and the period of weaker trading. </p>
                        <p class="statement__info-txt">Further details of the trading and financial performance of the business during the year are provided in the Financial Review section of this report.</p>
                        <p class="statement__info-txt">We have a clear strategy for growth underpinned by strong cash flows and the Board remains positive about the Group’s long-term prospects for the business. We are also encouraged by a strong trading performance in the first nine weeks of the current financial year.</p>

                        <p class="statement__info-txt">The Board is recommending an aggregate dividend payout of £5.5 million, representing a dividend per share of 14.0 pence, which reflects the Board’s confidence in the Company’s future and is in line with our commitment at the time of our IPO. This level of payout is the equivalent of a dividend yield of 8% at the IPO issue share price of 175 pence per share. </p>
                        <p class="statement__info-txt">Governance and the Board <br> We have put together a strong, balanced Board with a good blend of skills and relevant experience. David Knight, CEO, and Ron Turnbull, CFO, were joined on the Board by myself and two other independent Non-Executive Directors: Ron McMillan at the time of the IPO, and George Adams more recently. Paul Daccus continues on the Board as a non-independent Non-Executive Director having been appointed by Sun Capital Partners Management V, LLC in their capacity as principal shareholder. </p>
                        <p class="statement__info-txt">Ron Turnbull announced in early August 2015 that he intends to step down from the Board once a successor has been identified. We are very grateful to Ron for the significant contribution he has made to ScS during his 11 years with the business and wish him well for the future. </p>
                        <p class="statement__info-txt">Ron McMillan is the senior Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Audit Committee. George Adams is Chair of the Remuneration Committee. They each contribute diverse, thoughtful and informed perspectives and also apply independent judgement and assiduous oversight to the operation of the Board.</p>

                        <p class="statement__info-txt">On behalf of the Board I would like to thank everyone in ScS, whether they work in stores, in the supply chain or in the office support areas, for their continued dedication and hard work. We want ScS to continue to be a great place to work and to shop, because only through the commitment and expertise of our colleagues can we deliver our mission to provide our customers with excellent service, value and quality.</p>

We expect to benefit from this trend as we continue to pursue our strategy which is tightly focused on the targeted marketing of our range of branded and own designed products through our national ScS store portfolio, our House of Fraser concessions and our rapidly growing online channel.</p>
